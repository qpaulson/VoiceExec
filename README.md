VoiceExec
=========

Take Control of your PC with Voice Recognition via Google Speech to Text and Google Text to Speach.

This tool is based on the idea from Stephen Hickson ( http://stevenhickson.blogspot.ca/2013/06/voice-command-v30-for-raspberry-pi.html ).
VoiceCommand is a neat tool, however there were a couple issues with VoiceCommand that I wanted to resolve. The major one being I want to allow an indefinate amount of time for any given command.

This is in its early stages, so check back later on or feel free to jump in and lend a hand in writing a great Voice Exec front end for Home/PC Automation.
